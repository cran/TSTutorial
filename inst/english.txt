The objective of the program is to get predictions of the series
which starts in
and with a period
. Firstly, it is  recomended to make an exploratory analysis to get a previous idea of the series behaviours and properties. Then, the next step is 'Transformations'.
To can obtain models to get good predictions, the series has to be stationary (see the vignette 'Stacionarity' or select the option 2). For this, if it necessary, you have to make certain transformations. Firstly it has to check the uniform of the variance, if it is not uniform, in most cases, it is solved applying logarithm.
Once we have an stationary series we can identify its possible models. To can do it, you have to look its ACF/PACF plot and, then, introduce the found models
Once we have some models, we have to estimate them and, in case it has no significative coefficients, depends on the case, you have to fix these coefficients or modify the models until they have significative all their coefficients.
When we have significative models, the last step is the validation where we may rule out the invalid models.
With the obtained valid models you can obtain predictions but it can be some differences between the quality (Reality aproximation) in these predictions. Also, these models could not be steady (The same model fitted without the lastest observations has coefficients very different). For this, it is recomended analyze the stability and the prediction capacity of the different valid models to then choose the best model and proceed to the 'Atypical Analysis' or to get 'Long-term Predictions'. The advisable number of reservations is one period of the series. 
The atypic treatment allows to obtain the series that would exist if the unexpected events, which have caused changes in the series, hadn't happened. In case to use the atypical treatment, with the obtained series, the program readdress to the menu 'Transformations' to restart (The linealized series mantains the transformation applied to obtain constant variance). For the atypical detection be optimal, it is necessary that the active model was the best model created.
Once you have a good model, you can obtain long-term predictions. Remember that the confident intervals are at 95% of confidence.

observations.
A stable model is when the same model without the reserved observations mantains similar values of the original model coefficients. In  case to be a quite a lot of differents it can be an indication of the atypical presence in the last part of the series.
SUGGESTION: It seems that the model is a quite a lot of unstable because many coefficients have changed considerably in its values. You should choose another model to analyze its prediction capacity because its MSE will be very high. Another option is to make an 'Atypical treatment' and then draw conclusions.
SUGGESTION: It seems that the model is a little bit unstable, it could be for the existance of atypical values in the lastest observations from the series.
